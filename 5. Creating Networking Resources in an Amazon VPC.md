# Creating Networking Resources in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud

In this lab, we play the role of cloud support to address customer issues. The customer has mentioned that they don't know how to ping from within their VPC to the outside, and they've requested our assistance in enabling ping from their servers.
Our task is to create the architecture as depicted in the diagram. First, we will create a VPC with the IP address range 192.168.0.0/18. Following that, we'll set up subnets within the VPC, create an Internet Gateway, and attach it to the VPC. We will also establish a route table and configure it by adding a destination 0.0.0.0/0 route pointing to the Internet Gateway. This will allow us to connect to the internet. Subnet associations will be performed as well.
The next steps involve creating a Network Access Control List (NACL) and security groups. For the NACL, we will allow all inbound and outbound traffic by default. In contrast, for the security group, we will permit traffic for the SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS ports.
Once the infrastructure setup is complete, we will proceed to create an instance within the subnet. After creating the instance, we will SSH into it. Once we are inside the instance, we will be able to ping to the outside of the VPC.
