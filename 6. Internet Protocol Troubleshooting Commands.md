# Internet Protocol Troubleshooting Commands


In this lab, we learn how to troubleshoot at specific layers within the OSI model, which include layers 3, 4, and 7. At layer 3, we can use the ping and traceroute commands. Ping is used to test the connection to a server, while traceroute provides more detailed information about the connections between connected hubs up to the server. With traceroute, we can view the path and latency at each hop. If packet failures occur near the end of the route, there may be a server-side issue. Moving on to layer 4, we can use the netstat and telnet commands. Netstat is used to display current TCP connections, while telnet is used to check if a port is open or not. If a port is not open, the connection will be refused.
At the application layer, or layer 7, we can use the curl command. If we receive a response with a status code of 200, it indicates that the website is running successfully.
