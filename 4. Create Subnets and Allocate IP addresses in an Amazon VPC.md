In this laboratory, we learn how to determine CIDR blocks based on customer needs. Customers require approximately 15,000 IP addresses within their VPC and will allocate 50 IP addresses for their public subnets. To assist in determining the appropriate CIDR block, including subnet masks, host address ranges, subnet ID IPs, and IP broadcast addresses, we can easily use web-based open-source applications like IP Subnet Calculator. In the case of our customers, we need /18 because the total number of bits is 32. So, 32-18=14, and 2^14=16,384 host IP addresses, which closely matches the customer's requirement of around 15,000 IP addresses.
Next, for the public subnets, we will use  /26. So, 32-26=6, and 2^6=64 host IP addresses, which closely matches the customer's need for approximately 50 IP addresses. For this subnet, we can use Class C private IP addresses.
